Trả lời câu hỏi "What is a flow chart?":Flowchart Python is essentially the Python programming language in visual form.
You write a program by setting up a flowchart. When you run the flowchart, the software compiles to python byte-code, so that you can
easily import modules you write in Flowchart Python into standard Python programs. Flowchart Python does make a few additions to standard
Python, which will be outlined on the home page eventually.

print("Hi")
print("Nam nay ban bao nhieu tuoi")
tuoi = input()
print(int(tuoi))
if int(tuoi) < 16:
    print("Ban be hon toi")
elif int(tuoi) == 16:
    print("Ban bang tuoi toi")
elif int(tuoi) > 16:
    print("Ban lon hon toi")
elif 18 < int(tuoi) < 25:
    print("Ban da den tuoi di lam")
else:
    print("Ko quan tam")
